I finally visited family in Totonicapan and even got to practice my K'iche' with my grandmother, who is a monolingual speaker. However, Guatemalans have this habit of, after telling them you are learning their Indigenous language, speaking to you as if you have a native proficiency. So, my interactions went something like: "Do you have a girlfriend yet?" "Oh, about six weeks." "What's her name, and what does her father do?" "There are nine others from different parts of the United States. We all love to explore together!"

Still, I have each of my teachers to thank for this gift of conversation with my family. Throughout this summer, I have listened to Guatemala's history with each guest speaker who discussed the preservation efforts of Indigenous languages after the genocide ended some twenty years ago.

> Tu familia no lloraron lagrimas de agua, lloraban sangre / Your family did not cry tears of water; they were crying blood.

Even while investigating the history of my father's hometown—Chivarreto, Totonicápan—I found that over thirty percent of the working population live in the United States, most of whom live in California, a direct response to the imported U.S. violence. These migrants from Los Angeles, including my father, sent remittance to the town and funded the large "Chivarreto" sign to honor their new home, parodying the Hollywood sign. 

To best explain how difficult our Indigenous and migrant story is for me to digest, I should clarify that K'iche' translates literally to "many trees" or forest. Listening to my family's history and experiences during the armed conflict inserts the image of wildfires and forest slashings, the senseless violence against the K'iche' people and their homes. 

Despite oral narratives being a pillar for Indigenous storytelling, my father struggles to describe his childhood in Guatemala. Instead, history forces me to keep his story, yet it is something I can never hold. 

The best way to describe this emotion is through the following excerpt Riley presented me with:

>"The other day, I peeked into a Church past sundown and saw a woman laying in the aisle, her head pressed into the burgundy carpet—I understood."
