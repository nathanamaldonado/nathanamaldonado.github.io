Do you want to know how long I hid my chest tattoo from my parents? A week? A month? Nope. Immediately after my appointment, my mom and I went to the grocery store. Instead of being normal and asking if I was wearing the necklace my Jefe bought me, she lifted my shirt in the store to see for herself, exposing my tattoo. The both of us were thrown into shock, instead hysterically and violently laughing until I was eventually forced to explain myself.

I had been staying with my parents in the Central Valley for a week after their home invasion because both my brothers were still in school, and the thought of them interacting with the police still terrified me. The situation suddenly brought me back to when I was a child when my parents had to explain why our family specifically had to be more than careful with the police, why my dad had never been to San Diego after thirty years of living in California, and why my mom could not go to college. 

"La policia no te cuida" would burn at me like a housefire.  

Still, being in Fresno meant exploring Yosemite with my parents and taking the same photo of Tunnel View while my father explained how Riley and Aaron are always welcome to join our family in these traditions. Before we left, though, I opened our soda bottles by striking them with a knife, leaving my parents to wonder what exactly I had been up to in North Carolina.

Finally, I returned to Los Angeles, where my extended family celebrated my Abuelita's seventieth birthday. I gifted her another blanket I knit in her favorite color, and as I have mentioned before, there is no greater love than a generational tradition, and those hours spent performing surgery on my mistakes meant all the satisfaction in her smile upon opening her present.

Finally, before leaving California for my study abroad program through Tulane, I was met with a farewell from my friends and family, including Karmen and Luke. Once I landed in Guatemala City, I noticed someone following me, and I soon realized this was one of the people I had previously "researched," Jaymin, who is also part of my program. My new experiences in Antigua and Quetzaltenango surrounded me, and I became increasingly closer to the people in my cohort, including Jaymin, Katie, Willie, Sam, Nathan, Natalie, Thomas, and Sydney. 

The most intense feeling, which I have still not overcome, is the knowledge that my walk to school mirrored that of my dad when he was a teenager in Guatemala. So, while I can tell my children I hiked mountains to get to school, I will not share the same experiences as him. While his own father would wait for him at the city center after class to then return home, mine could only see Xela through pixels.
