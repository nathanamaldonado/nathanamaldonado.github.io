After years of anticipation and upset, I was finally met with the challenge of admitting my love for the anguish, strife, and hurt the senior class had caused me. I have fallen, but I must complete my finals before these farewells.

Notably, I reunited with Bianca to conclude our time together at Duke University as the very person who had conducted my undergraduate scholarship interview and had also become my older sister under the guise of peer mentorship, but through the stages of debauchery. Eventually, we parted ways, and our goodbye was just that—good and absolute. You would witness my life from beginning to end if you could only hear our last moments together. 

Finally, I left campus in a packed car with Aaron, Riley, and Dalya as we headed for Washington, D.C., driving along the North Carolina coast and Northern Virginia to stay with their families. Our first night, however, meant first honoring Bianca and her gifts over these three years; of course, we imbibed a generous bottle of Grey Goose under the sunset in Outer Banks, huddled around each other as our cigarettes+ fought the breeze.

Moreover, meals with both their families provided insight into their curation, as short quips between siblings offered Dalya her wit, and unanswered questions offered Riley her enigmatic style. Nevertheless, in between stops, we stopped at William and Mary to visit Lia, Ariana, and Sarah, whose air conditioning unit roared into the night, reminding me of earthquake drills in elementary school in Southern California. In any case, I continued in this direction of goodbyes and was abandoned by these lovely people until August, when the semester began, the start of our senior year.

Well, I landed in San Diego and made the journey to La Jolla with Isaak, only to leave quickly thereafter for Irvine with Ethan, where we were met with horror upon finding my godparents at the same dispensary we had been shopping at. Nevertheless, the shock of those few minutes when my godfather asked which strain I preferred meant very little following the events soon to unfold in New York City. 

Upon my arrival during the New Jersey Transit rail strike, I made the journey to Brooklyn Heights, where I would be living for the Duke in New York program with a randomly assigned roommate. To summarize the situation over these two weeks, I once was showering in our private bathroom and exited briefly into the hallway as Cyril had knocked, only to shout: "Nathan, would you mind hurrying up? I have to use the restroom." Sure, of course. 

Well, upon stepping into the hallway, he handed me back toiletries, only to start the shower himself. So, I stood there in the hallway wearing only my towel with body wash in one hand and shampoo in the other. Surely, he did not interrupt my shower to shower himself. Well, he did. 

And that has been New York City.
