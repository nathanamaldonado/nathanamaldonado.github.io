Every so often, I imagine my life in San Francisco as the software engineer I had been groomed to become, and I picture the former Stanford student who spoke in my seventh-grade science classroom with everything a child of immigrants could want.

Now, I have come to understand his performance. Returning to North Carolina meant reuniting with friends, especially the seniors, who would be one step removed from all the daydreams and illusions. First, though, my flight from San Francisco International would have to take off, and I would have to finally end my tour around this city I once felt would become my home.  

Well, I landed in Durham and found that I would be living with a sophomore, also from San Francisco, named Elliot. He towered over his girlfriend and any audience, yet they both graced me with their rapid composure upon entering the roomâ€”his room, he made clear. Now, I await the uncomfortable reassignment so that he and his best friend can live out their life together as one happy family: my roommate, his girlfriend, and his best friend. 

Nevertheless, I would later give a part of myself to North Carolina as she gave me my first sight of snowfall. I had been working on overdue papers from my classes in London at the time, taking harrowing study breaks and chainsmoking cigarettes on the scattered ice outside. Aaron then appeared on West Campus, stranded with no salt on the roads to bring him home. So, the following morning, Elliot woke to a shirtless man in my bed as I worked away at my desk.  

The snow melted away, but I remained distracted by the unnatural chaos at home. Watching Los Angeles burn fired within me the same emotions I had felt the first time I left for college. Yet, I left California not in search of anything or anyone but with the hope I could eventually create myself. I left my family alone. 

Eventually, the fires calmed, and I continued in these ceremonies with friends: light herbal refreshment with Irma in the gardens, sleepovers with Riley only to continue our rendezvous into the next morning, and frivolous house parties with Michael. January seemed to leave as I left it.
