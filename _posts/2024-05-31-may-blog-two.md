Never in my life have I been tested more than by the Los Angeles Metro. Way too often, I have played with God and His mandatesâ€”my Abuelita and curfew. Though, I was never alone in riding the last train eastbound, as I was often accompanied by mariachis visiting their secret second families in Exposition Park and transplants getting to their gluttonous studio apartments in the Arts District.

My homecoming was marked by Aaron's visit to Los Angeles, where Milly and I waited for his and Irma's (late) arrival to Chinatown. Eventually, we introduced them to Echo Park's gentrification, totally bringing in local businesses and making our neighborhoods safer! Still, being on Sunset, I could already feel the pretentious WeHo queer community rattling my bones and flaying my skin to compliment their leather suits. 

That said, I wanted to share my worst first date experience. I had matched with someone and later matched with this person again a week later, but his name was different this time. I figured it was because he was Hispanic, and having two names is fairly common. Eventually, he showed up with hickeys all over his neck and told me to take my earrings out because they ruined my face. Later, he told me how I should feel guilty for keeping my parents in the United States when they have only ever wanted to return to Mexico and Guatemala. Now, I was already going to block him, but when I told him, "Goodbye [His Name], it was nice meeting you," he told me, "Oh, my god. That's my twin's name." 

Immediately after this exchange, the bus sent him back to Huntington Park, and I almost broke my phone after hitting the block button. 

Still, home has not been all hectic. I even visited other friends, like Rhea and Elias, at UCLA. Pretending to be a student at the Westwood Farmer's Market reminded me of how calm the air is in California. Someone once told me that everyone here is probably microdosing, and while I still think that's an exaggeration, there is some truth to that. 

Oh, and my parent's home was broken into, so maybe California is not all that tranquil. Still, I read somewhere that in Guatemala, an ajq'ij (Maya priest) is more likely to be the victim of multiple robberies before being identified as a potential spiritual guide. So, I am urging mi Jefe to pursue this next career path.
