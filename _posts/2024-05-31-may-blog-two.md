Never in my life have I been tested more than by the Los Angeles Metro. Way too often, I have played with God and His mandates—my Abuelita and curfew. Though, I was never alone in riding the last train eastbound, as I was often accompanied by mariachis visiting their secret second families in Exposition Park and transplants getting to their gluttonous studio apartments in the Arts District.

My homecoming was marked by Aaron's visit to Los Angeles, where Milly and I waited for his and Irma's (late) arrival to Chinatown. Eventually, we introduced them to Echo Park's gentrification, totally bringing in local businesses and making our neighborhoods safer! Still, being on Sunset, I could already feel the pretentious WeHo queer community rattling my bones and flaying my skin to compliment their leather suits. 

That said, I wanted to share my worst first date experience. I had matched with someone and then again but under a different name after about a week. Initially, I figured it was because two names are common for Hispanics—Nathanael Alejandro—for instance. Eventually, this terror showed up with hickeys and told me to take my earrings out because they ruined my face. Later, they told me how I should feel guilty for keeping my parents in the United States when they only wanted to return to Mexico and Guatemala. Now, I was already going to block, but when I said, "Goodbye [ Name ], it was nice meeting you," they responded, "Oh, my god. That's my twin's name." 

Immediately after this exchange, the bus sent them back to Huntington Park, and I almost broke my phone after hitting the block button so fast. 

Still, home has not been all hectic. I even visited other friends, like Rhea and Elias, at UCLA. Pretending to be a student at the Westwood Farmer's Market reminded me of how calm the air is in California. Someone once told me that everyone here is probably microdosing, and while I still think that's an exaggeration, there is some truth to that. 

Oh, and my parent's home was broken into, so maybe California is not all that tranquil. Still, I read somewhere that in Guatemala, an ajq'ij (Maya priest) is more likely to be the victim of multiple robberies before being identified as a potential spiritual guide. So, I am urging mi Jefe to pursue this next career path.
