February soon arrived, bringing with it the same intensity that powers through student crowds and sets the campus ablaze. The Duke-UNC game for the rest of us, though, provides us with another excuse to set schoolwork aside and let the soulless in finance and tech earn their way ahead—the only only actual productive ones on this campus.

Following the rivalry celebrations with friends, I would soon wake up to a now-familiar position. Irma would welcome me into her home, and each time, we would stumble inside only to greet Dani and Michael as they sat in front of the television, watching the latest from Quina Brunsen. The two of us would soon become this unit we mimicked our first year in college, wearing my wired headphones around campus and disturbing our house course with our dinners. 

On one such outing, Irma and I met with Sergio and Avery to begin a tradition of playing vintage video games and watching budget movies in his Swift apartment. Every morning, we would wake to selfies of us asleep on the couch with the television glowing in the background and no recollection of the night before.

Some work still had to be done, though, and I would often find myself studying late into the night with Leo, where we would discuss our classmates' affairs or reach inside vending machines, never a moot effort. We would soon host an event together for Mirecourt rush, taking inspiration from Bianca's lighter decorating function. 

As I think about Bianca and her approaching graduation, I am compelled to reflect on the people I will soon see leave and how they have impacted my life more than lighter decorating with other evildoers. So, I have begun this endeavor with Irma to help these seniors fall in love with us—never to forget us as we could never forget them. 

Our mission began with Olivia and Molly, whose balcony we soon became accustomed to after a routine drive around Durham, accompanied by fast food and cocktails. Irma and Molly would then get their piercings, though not from the same man who would send Austin to the emergency room during Mirecourt rush. Though, for providing that recommendation to him and the freshman I shortly adopted, Bella, I do apologize. Whoops. 

Later, we set off to Hollows and accepted Emily's invitation to her Valentine's Day party alongside our other friends. Here, I met Jay for the second time, the first being during my orientation as my leader and an overall presence around campus. He then reminded me of my unique gait, which I had adopted from my father in grade school, as he had insisted I mimic his walk. Shortly after, I adopted the stride of a man in his mid-thirties, and at a Valentine's Day party years later, I would be reminded of this by my orientation leader. 

In any case, he provided me with a handsome presence I would carry with me into the semester, which has forced me to consider the toll of these goodbyes and whether they would all be good and final. 

Nevertheless, my story of novel meetings was not over; I would soon find out. Instead, I hauled my belongings over to the new room Elliot had assigned me in Craven, where I met my new roommate, Pedro, an economics major originally from Portugal but studying abroad in North Carolina. In meeting my friends, they each acquired a nickname: Irma, the one I am always with; Riley, the one who always slams the door; and Aaron, the one who is always sleeping. 

Nevertheless, February and its mischief soon caught up with me, and I would find refuge in spreading myself across campus. The month ended with these people by my side, listening to French pop, smoking menthols, and falling asleep on the rooftop of Grainger Hall as the sunset. It was good.
