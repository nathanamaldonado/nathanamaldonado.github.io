February soon arrived, bringing with it the same intensity that powers through student crowds and sets the campus ablaze. The Duke-UNC game for the rest of us, though, provides us with another excuse to set schoolwork aside and let the soulless in finance and tech earn their way ahead, the only ones pretending to remain productive on this campus.

After spending the game with Riley and Irma, I would soon wake up in a position that, soon enough, would become familiar. Irma would have to make room for me in her home, each time stumbling in to greet Dani and Michael as they sat in front of the television, watching the latest from Quina Brunsen. The two of us would soon become this unit we mimicked our first year in college, wearing the same earbuds around campus and disturbing our house course with our meals. 

On one such outing, Irma and I met with Sergio and Avery to begin a tradition of playing vintage video games and watching budget movies. Every morning, we would wake to several selfies of the two of us on the couch with no recollection of the night before, the television glowing in the background. We would do it all over again on the following snow day, which brought me back to our earlier years when my room stood as a forum for those ready to skip class and play hooky.

Some work had to be still done, though, and I would often find myself studying far from the dorms as motivation not to leave and face the cold. Leo would usually accompany me on smoke breaks in between, where we would discuss our classmates affairs as Mirecourt prepared for rush. Often, he would catch me reaching inside vending machines, as I could never return from war barren of food for our family: Aaron, Dalya, and Riley.  

We would soon host an event together, taking inspiration from Bianca's lighter decorating function the year prior. And, with graduation on the horizon, I am compelled to reflect on the people I will soon see leave and how they have impacted my life. So, I have begun this endeavor with Irma to help them fall in love with usâ€”never to forget us as we could never forget them. 

Our mission began with Olivia and Molly, whose balcony we soon became accustomed to after a routine drive around Durham, accompanied by fast food and cocktails to suit the night. Irma and Molly would then get their piercings, though not from the same man who would send Austin to the emergency room during rush. Though, for providing that recommendation to him and the freshman I shortly adopted, Bella, I do apologize. ater, we set off to Hollows, where we would soon be living for the coming year, and accepted Emily's invitation to her Valentine's Day party alongside our other senior friends, to whom we would soon say goodbye. Here, I met Jay for the second time, the first being during my orientation as my leader and an overall presence around campus. He then reminded me of my unique walk, which I had adopted from my father in grade school, as he had insisted I mimic his walk. Shortly after, I adopted the stride of a man in his mid-thirties, and at a Valentine's Day party years later, I would be reminded of it by my orientation leader. In any case, he provided me with a handsome presence I would carry with me into the semester, which has forced me to consider the toll of these goodbyes. 

Nevertheless, my story of meeting was not over; I would soon find out. Instead, I would find myself hauling my belongings over to the new room Elliot had assigned me. Here, I met my new roommate, Pedro, an economics major originally from Portugal but studying abroad in North Carolina. In meeting my friends, they each acquired a nickname: Irma, the one from Los Angeles; Riley, the one who slammed the door; and Aaron, the one who always seemed to be sleeping. 

February and its mischief soon caught up with me, and I would find refuge in spreading myself across campus. The month ended with these people by my side, listening to French pop, smoking menthols, and falling asleep on the rooftop of Grainger Hall as the sunset.
