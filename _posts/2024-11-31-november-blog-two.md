I had only ever seen white people on television or in front of a classroom. I could never begin to understand why a man of color, as President of the United States, could even make headlines. Then, I finally met a *white, white* person. I understood.

I had once wondered why I chose Duke or, worse, why the institution chose me. I cast my vote with the belief that I could influence North Carolina, but I awoke to a text from Isaak stating our final solution could be found along the ocean floor. I knew. 

I was brought back to reading (Yes, I know... but still) *The Freedom Writers Diary*: 

> "So when Ms. G. kept saying that 'I could do anything,' 'go anywhere,' and 'be anyone'—even the President, I thought she was crazy. I always thought that the only people who went to college were rich white people. How did she expect me to go to college? After all, I live in the ghetto, and my skin is brown" (Gruwell, 1999, p. 153).

Thirty years later, you can only do what they let, go where they lead, and be who they want. 

## Italy and Milan
Immediately after, I took the most silent plane ride to Italy, where I glazed over messages from my non-American friends asking if the news had yet reached me. 

Finally, I touched down in Milan, where I spent the day in antique stores finding gifts for my parents and clashing with restaurant staff. Seemingly, I could point out every American wave in this sea. After the election, I began to loathe my American scent, which any European could recognize, yet I despised it if it were not recognized either.

At every introduction, I would murmur, "I am *so* sorry, but do you speak English?" To which one server replied, "Yes, how can I help you?" "Could I have a fork?" "What?" "Uh, fork? Tenedor? Fourchette?" After some time, another patron interrupted and hissed, "Una forchetta!" As if that had been so dissimilar from what I had been saying. 

I eventually left for Venice and called my parents to wish them sweet dreams while I was only now starting my day. The Mediterranean climate imitated the landscape of the California Central Valley, and for a brief second, I was on my way home. 

Amidst all the tourist attractions, cheap wine, and overpriced pasta, I found myself people-watching. This latest exhibition highlighted four women of a certain age, sisters or lifelong friends, feeding seagulls and pigeons—their laughter growing louder and louder. 

One could wonder if Americans are truly louder or if Europeans are not as focused on themselves but on others.

A young boy crawled up to them and asked for breadcrumbs to feed the birds. These women looked at each other and threw their bags of croutons at the boy, insisting he occupy the rest of his night teasing the Venetian wildlife. 

## Londres, Barcelona, y Madrid
Eventually, Aaron and Irma landed in London, and our journey started with Paddington in Peru, later a tour of Tower Bridge and, finally, the Faltering Fullback. 

Somewhere along the way, I lost some jewelry, yet Irma reminded me this was proof I was experiencing life and loss—proof I was moving. We were living and spent the rest of our time in London watching life after Sunday mass at Saint Paul's Cathedral and listening to Kendrick at Greenwich Park.

Eventually, their plane landed in Madrid, and mine in Barcelona only shortly after. Irma gave me an insight into her life these last few months, and our people-watching only continued as we surveyed families in row boats at Parque del Buen Retiro and discussed all those lost or misplaced to time. 

I could spend this lifetime and my rest learning all the world's languages that are and ever were and still never describe the love I hold for Aaron and Irma. 

## Final Dayss
Once my plane arrived from Madrid, Thanksgiving soon approached, and I fled to Oxford, where Aubteen had invited me as family to the Hertford College Thanksgiving. There, I dropped my fork with a crash so loud I finally began to understand the British culture of shame.

My November ended with yet another trip to the Faltering Fullback with Mattis. Upon showing him my latest read, he let me know the translation of a French passage was wrong: mérite un detour ("stop by if it is on the way"). Instead, he insisted, it means "stop by if it is *sort of* on the way." 

Finally, to all the incredible people I have met, I hope we see each other if it *mérite un detour*. See you!
