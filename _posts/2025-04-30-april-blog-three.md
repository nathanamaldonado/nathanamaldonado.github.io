Living across the country means more than homesickness from time to time; often, gifts from my brothers are delayed by the postal service and their lack of planning, though I cannot assign too much blame. They are still little, after all. Well, their gifts brought me to the past—to a time strolling to the library to burn the latest into my music player with vintage headphones, blocking out the rest of the student body on their own pilgrimage.

I ran into Jay one morning, and he retold the same lines I have heard a million times, "it is like you came out of a movie." Selom and the others put his words differently, telling me I am often in the atmosphere or just out of reach. This style of burdensome and vintage indifference has been a lifetime of creation, with each artist of my youth living as an experience and dying with me. Despite studying computer science, I understand that these technologies could never love the way I could. As such, living in the past with these vintage technologies sets me in the past, an impression of what was and what is to come. 

Of these artists, though, Lucas has become a figure of mine and Irma's repose. Attending his final performance of the year meant witnessing the development of his greatness and reading the program to see that all seniors presented would be moving into roles in finance and engineering. Soon, I will have to make these decisions for myself and watch as those closest to me negotiate their talents and futures. 

Eventually, the quinceanera came around, and I was brought to the attention of the crowd during my freshman year when Michael prompted them to sing "Happy Birthday" for me. This time around, I found myself surrounded not only by the people I have come to love since our first year in college but also by those I have met only recently, including Ayşe, Michael Shirin, and Joel. After roaming the gardens, we settled at the benches outside Wanamaker and celebrated our youth together. Irma and I would soon continue this streak with Diego at his Últimata Peda, though these "lasts" seemed to live forever. 

After one such night, Irma and I held onto visions of the future and decided to journey back home, well, San Francisco. We soon would find ourselves being driven to RDU by Riley and Aaron, mimicking drives from last year, but to Irma's point, "Some of y'all didn't make it out." We landed at SFO and stayed with her older sister, which was unusual for me as this would be the first time I had ever felt like a younger sibling. Despite the older members of my family, I could never describe their protection and conversation as I could that first night in the city. Afterward, we met with Jahir and spent the two most significant holidays at the University of California at Berkeley: Cal Day and 4/20, which fell on the same weekend. Here, I discovered the life of university students at the best public school in the nation. The brightest minds here attended public school once and loved it so much they would do it a second time, committing themselves to annual debauchery and a suspect cloud of smoke.  

The Last Day of Classes at Duke would serve as our homecoming, starting with celebratory cocktails and herbal pleasures. Amidst the psychedelic interludes, however, the entire student body seemingly entered my room, and the following morning, I awoke to Irma in my bed and an upended room. While I am hopeful that the following months will be just as disorderly, this past month has proven to be a beautiful exit from junior year.
