The most challenging aspect of living so far from home is forfeiting the opportunity to celebrate anything that has ever mattered. Each September since my freshman fall, I whined and wailed as I thought of my younger brothers, who were now entering another year of their lives without me. Finally, though, I had the opportunity to celebrate alongside them; "I have missed you" destroys me a million times over. Though, I know this feeling will not last forever.

Later, my family sent me away, and I struggled to articulate a goodbye, knowing that I had the privilege of citizenship and travel. Even after experiencing death after my seventeen-hour-long back tattoo, this farewell wounded me like a train running itself across my body and life. I cannot get enough. 

Watching the London skyline from my high-rise apartment meant a painfully stunning video call with my family as they said: please travel the world for me. This brought me back to spending time with Irma, staring at my ceiling, saying nothing, as we watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL_YMm9C6tw" target="_blank">audition scene from La La Land</a>. Thank you for dreaming with me. 

I share and extend this gratitude to everyone I have been lost with since arriving in London. Thank you to Mina, Vysa, Fatouma, Mathis, Summer, Lia, Nancy, Sarah, Sophie, and Rishi. 

Still, some of Duke arrived alongside me in the UK, and I had the opportunity to visit Aubteen at Oxford, where I snuck into a library older than nations and was promptly pierced with adrenaline. This is any scholar's final enemy, my magnum opus of academically inspired hijinks and mischief.Â 

Later, throughout our scenic meadow walk and while people-watching, I overheard a lovely passerby whisper: 

>"All I have left to do now is have an easy life."

I have nothing more to say.
