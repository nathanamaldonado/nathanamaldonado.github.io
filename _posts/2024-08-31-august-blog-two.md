Once the program ended, I flew into Atlanta to visit Aaron, and at one point, a friend of his asked what we had done so far. Upon telling him, he responded, “Oh, he’s showing you the real Atlanta—the ‘I know a spot’ type of places” you would take someone to before plotting on their collapse. Oh, okay! Still, I am more than grateful to Aaron and his family for the time spent people-watching at the High Museum and lamenting in his mom's car.

Finally, I returned to Los Angeles and outlived the Orange County Fair with Karmen before my Abuelita called me unexpectedly. She was calling to ask if I was free the next couple of days, and upon saying yes, she let me know that we were going to Mexico. Oh, okay! 

Once we arrived, I was greeted by family I had only ever spoken to on the phone and recognized through Polaroid pictures from when my mom was a girl. 

However, amidst the street tacos and late-night Lotería, someone went to greet my Abuelita while on the street. Before I could introduce myself, my grandfather quickly shouted: el es japonés, chino, algo así—por eso el se parece así (He’s Japanese, Chinese, something like that. That’s why he looks like that). 

Every time I introduce myself to people, I express that I am Guatemalan, and at every opportunity, I am bluntly reminded that I am also Mexican—as if I had forgotten. I am not ashamed of my heritage and am not trying to neglect my family’s history, either. My racial experience in the United States and Mexico is just fundamentally different as indigenous Guatemalan. 

So, as people remind my father, my brothers, and me that we ‘look Asian’ by other Mexicans (including our family), we have to remind them that our Asian features—hooded eyes, pin-straight hair, and high cheekbones—do not come from across the Pacific but from Ixim Ulew (K’iche’: ‘land of corn’ or Guatemala). 

Still, Mexico was chill.
