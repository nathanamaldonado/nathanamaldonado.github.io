I could tell you about my life through stories and attempt to reimagine time, but I will instead share with you all about yours:

> "Sé que tú no puedes, aunque intentes olvidarme, siempre volverás, una y otra vez, una y otra vez, siempre volverás. Aunque ya no sientes más amor por mí, solor rencor." [I know that you can't, even if you try to forget me, you will always come back, and again, and again, you will always come back. Although you no longer feel love for me, only resentment.] ~ Rocío Dúrcal, Costumbres

> "Ma ta k'o je wa' jw ri' xqariqo kqak’ulmaj." [That we may not encounter difficult times.] ~ Ixtahuacan

> "Toutes les grandes personnes ont d'abord été des enfants. Mais, peu d'entre elles s'en souviennent." [All grown-ups were once children, but only few of them remember.] ~ Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, Le Petit Prince

> "But then if you're so smart / Then tell me, why are you still so afraid? Mm / ... / But you know that when the truth is told / That you can get what you want or you can just get old" ~ Billy Joel, Vienna

> "If you want to be a grocer, or a general, or a politician, or a judge, you will invariably become it; that is your punishment. If you never know what you want to be, if you live what some might call the dynamic life but what I will call the artistic life, if each day you are unsure of who you are and what you know you will never become anything, and that is your reward.” ~ Oscar Wilde

> “He made me think of home—perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.” ~ James Baldwin, Giovanni’s Room

> “In writing of my journeys I am done with talk of death except as it is a part of life, one side of a sphere whose roundness would otherwise be incomplete. In a letter to his protégé Émile Bernard, van Gogh wrote, 'The earth had been thought to be flat... science has proved that the earth is round... they persist nowadays in believing that life is flat and runs from birth to death. However, life, too, is probably round.' Show me the beginning and ending of a sphere; then I will show you the beginning and ending of a life.” ~ Fenton Johnson, Geography of the Heart
