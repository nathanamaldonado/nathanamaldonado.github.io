Hi, hi! As part of my international comparative studies course here in Seoul, I chose to upload my site notes to my blog in order to document my experiences in Korea. Please continue reading, but you will probably have to scroll a bunch.

## \[1\] First Impressions of Seoul
### My family's K-Town

My father would often remind me to correct my posture because, at five years old, I would usually lean and hold a conversation with my head tilted off to the side. So, outside our church, every Sunday, he would ask me to mimic his steps exactly, meaning I would eventually adopt the gait of a man in his mid-thirties as a child. Just beyond our church in Koreatown, on Wilshire and Normandie, my father would hold me back while letting my brothers enter the service. 

I recall that the other parents outside were also giving their children lessons on etiquette before entering, and I continued with this idea that all churches were this way, attending three times a week until the pandemic. Eventually, I learned better and asked my parents why we attended service farther away when we lived in Boyle Heights, to which my father let me know he and my mother had been members since my father's arrival in the United States after fleeing the Guatemalan Indigenous genocide in 1992. 

That same year, tensions between minority groups in the area arose, and my dad arrived in Pico-Union. In this nearby ghetto, he naturally found Spanish services offered. It was there that he eventually met my mother and learned English, as she had arrived in the United States nearly a decade prior. My parents found comfort here, but they would often remind me of the struggle in Koreatown following the riots and how, for these reasons, I should be considerate of the space we occupy and how we represent not just our family but people as well. Peace and presentation was the aim, so I wound up sitting on the curb on many an occasion when I could not maintain this appearance as a hyperactive child (allegedly). 

Thus, before I arrived at ICN, my family reminded me of their experiences, and while I welcomed their input, there lives a clear distinction between the past and present and the unique circumstances of my departure to Seoul. Nevertheless, walking through these neighborhoods, late in Itaewon or bright and early in Sinchon, I am reminded of the fight for visibility on a global scale as I consider how my family's history in Los Angeles is tied to that of the Korean people and diaspora. 

Following the riots, tensions remained high, and several churches in the area with Spanish services began losing numbers. Yet, the shared market and hustle culture inspired my latest journey into Gwangjang Market for any and all vegetarian options with Nabarissa as my allergies to meat reappeared. Maybe this resurrgence is my sign to follow my parents and attend a service directly after a night with friends. We will see.

## \[2\] Soundscape
### Sounds of the bathhouse 

The idea of a bath with dozens of other men may not appeal to everyone. Still, having frequented traditional sweat lodges with the men in my family, I have become accustomed to such a routine; though, my experience at this bathhouse was anything but customary. 

Upon entering the bathhouse, I was immediately confronted with the soundscape of the city, as the bustling traffic raced alongside pedestrians, and motorcycles evaded traffic by skidding their tires onto pedestrian-only pavement. At the same time, streetcars whirred at red lights, waiting for the moment to force a hiss from their engines when the light turned green. 

Nevertheless, walking up the stairs to the bathhouse prompted me to consider this culture of discretion and a ceremony of whispering, as the attendant requested that I take my shoes off before determining whether I was a decent enough foreigner to meet the expectations of the local clientele. Well, I am; and, I was granted entry. 

After securing my belongings, the associate offered me a washcloth and bath towel, along with the other paraphernalia you would expect at one of these establishments. Well, as I entered the showers, I knew this was not a sauna I would recommend to the other men in my family. No, this was more open-minded. 

Passing through the rooms, however, strengthened my understanding of contemporary living in Seoul, as the sound of lighters igniting cigarettes echoed throughout the first-floor locker room. Whereas, upstairs, the smack of sandals against the tile and wood floors moved almost in unison, calculated to mimic the gait of the man in front of you. 

Before leaving, however, I noticed foreigners speaking English, which also contributed to my acquaintance with the soundscape of Korea, as the influence of the American Empire has led English to become a de facto language, even among those who are not from the Anglophone world. Yet, I would only encounter more of this familiar soundscape upon my arrival in Itaewon. 

Despite most queer nightclubs championing K-pop, Itaewon sits as a mecca for foreign-born and local people interested in dancing and nightlife, meaning weekends in the summer mean promoters grabbing the attention of passersbys as electronic, Latin, and house music fill the streets. Once the night wore off, however, and the bus back to Sinchon arrived, exhausted students chose to respect the peace by practicing silence as early morning commuters head into work.

Eventually, my night (now morning) ended with the Sounds of Seoul running back in my head as I dozed off and almost missed my station. The howls from the sauna, international accents, lighters catching cigarettes, and racing streetcars will definitely be hard to forget. 

## \[3\] Cityscape
### Highs and heights

The fires in Los Angeles earlier this year prompted me to reflect on my adolescence, which was largely defined by dates starting in Downtown Los Angeles and ending with a drive alongside the Pacific Coast Highway, culminating at secluded vistas hidden beneath light pollution and flickering starlight. 

The Wilshire Grand Center in Downtown Los Angeles features a wine bar on the seventy-first floor, offering an unparalleled view of the entire peninsula, with the rolling mountains running alongside the Los Angeles skyline. Since discovering the observation deck after a failed attempt to find parking in DTLA, the Wilshire Grand has seen my courtship evolution as I boast about my city and home to unsuspecting outsiders. 

Furthermore, while living in New York City's Brooklyn Heights, I would take every opportunity for a scenic walk after a full day of classes, sitting for hours and contemplating my life after graduation. Though this was largely due to the herbal refreshments and carcinogenic Chinese cigarettes I had sourced from Flushing, Queens. During one such class, however, my professor proclaimed that the Los Angeles skyline and culture emulated that of New York City, but lying down. 

I had to consider my style and how I was an imitation of these values; I was an Angeleno, and you can see it in my carefree style, demeanor, and attitude. Yet, that of New York City was significantly more alive, evoking a sense of 'on-ness' as each tower serves to mark the permanence, legacy, and power of individuality and creative expression, from the Chrysler Building to the Flatiron Building in Manhattan. 

All of these experiences set the context for my perception of Seoul. After Angela and I arrived from California, we sped in a private car to Sinchon, where the skyline of Incheon merged with that of Seoul, playing off one another like a sibling rivalry. Immediately, Angela and I thought of how the architecture reflected the culture of South Korea. 

Sure, I could talk about how the nail that sticks out gets hammered down, which explains why every building, every person, wants to mimic one another. Still, this generalization largely overlooks how each building serves as someone's home, a life lived from beginning to end within these apartment buildings that stretch from Incheon to Seoul. Each apartment, instead, stands out as part of this effortless ideal, a tenet of Korean culture and values that has been drawn from Confucianism to the contemporary age. 

Sure, each building may look similar, but each stands tall and proud, its chest pumped high above the rest. Now, when I consider the skyline of my hometown in Southern California, I understand this Western notion of individualism, which aims not to serve the collective but to the self, with local cultural attire spread across the landscape.

## \[4\] Fashion
### Open-minded thrift stores

In my senior year of high school, a teacher dress-coded me for the tears in my pants. They were my favorite and only pair of blue jeans, so I stared back at her with no response and sat down in my seat. She urged me again to leave class so that I could call home. 

Not knowing what to say, I quickly responded with: These are my only pair. You are being anti-low income. 

Well, she felt bad and actually ended up writing a letter of recommendation for my application to Duke. In any case, I recognized from then (and even before) that my fashion was largely defined by thrift store finds, inherited pieces, and sentimental yet worn out clothing, making our days-long adventures at different shopping centers in Seoul laboursome as someone whose brother would absolutely lose it if he found out I was shopping for fast fashion items. 

My dedication to avoid these shopping centers is also an instance of my California elitism where everyone wants so badly to be different, yet I am not. Thus, I realized I struck gold after finding a thrift store in Hongdae with clothes in my size and not the standard XXL American sizes you would find at the Goodwill. 

I have since bought enough pieces to justify (though, not really) purchasing an extra luggage home, knowing my younger brothers will have a first round pick at my clothes before my cousins get to the rest. 

However, I must be doing something right to bring forward my California style as the students from Yonsei complemented my style, notably JJ whose camaraderie I earned after several impromptu cigarettes at dinner. Later, while waiting in line for a nightclub in Itaewon, Jisoo noticed the Marlboro Reds and custom wallet (which my ex had given me) both stuck out of my front pockets as my new tattoos peaked out slightly, leaving her to give me the Korean name Jimin. Though, as someone not Korean, I will leave it at that and up to your interpretation. 

So, going against the standard men's style of minimalist, loose-fitted clothing has earned me some points, not that I am seeking validation either. But, well, you know...

## \[5\] Food
### I swear I am not normally like this

At ten years old, I learned about love and loss, about life in the sun and shadows. Rather, I was taught these lessons from a control out of mine and felt the weight of lifetime placed onto me. Well, sort of. 

I decided to become vegetarian because of my food allergies and did not eat meat until after my high school graduation when my cousins pressured me into eating a full Caniac combo whose strong fried chicken smell hid the scent of the light herbal refreshments. 

Since, my allergies have fluctuated with the intensity of a lifelong relationship, one where we always just miss one another. In any case, they are back now, and my vegetarianism is here to stay for the sanity of myself and loved ones who believe I play too much with my livelihood. 

Thus, my meals back home quickly reverted to those of my childhood: beans, rice, and lentils. Well, being in Seoul has not been any different with rice serving as the fundamental food group and all else a compliment to her uniformity and universality. 

In particular, my favorite meal has been outside of the nightclub street in Itaewon where the proprietor has become accustomed to my service at six in the morning, knowing my order well: kimchi fried rice with an extra side of white rice. This meal comes as a gift to my soul and reminds me of the first time I had experienced the nightlife in Los Angeles after eating only banchan while my family gorged on their decadent meats before announcing they still had enough room for bubble tea. 

While food has not been particularly facile, these issues I would have anywhere else, and I am just lucky my options are not limited to salads and sandwiches. Instead, I can indulge in what I will now remember as a hangover cure before boarding the 110 bus to Sinchon and what was a memory of large meals with my family back home as they struggled with chopsticks. 

## \[6\] Gender
### Riding bikes and in cars with boys

The only time I knew someone to faint was at church when a close friend stopped in her tracks during communion, locked in her stride, and fell to the ground just before receiving the body of Christ. So, it shocked me when the only time I would faint, I earned a lifelong moniker from my father. 

After cycling for hours, my shorter legs as a child unable to maintain the pace of my father, I found the desert sun continued to beam down on me with hours left to go and no breaks in sight. Eventually, I wound up on the street with my father standing over me and asking why I was throwing up in the middle of the road. Heat exhaustion. Well, he did not like this exercise of femininity, and I earned the nickname “La Princessa.”

I understood the performance, so it did not help that I was also allergic to meat and vegetarian as a result. However, these once masculine figures in my life, I tower over, each with minimal legitimacy to my dominion. Yet, my sexuality forces them to question how someone ‘like me,’ could strike open a beer with a knife, roll my own spliffs in a moving car, recite every Latin rock song from their youth, and fall asleep on the table while receiving a spinal tattoo. 

While some behaviors I had to discontinue over fear of the Korean National Police Agency and Chloe's agency, I still found these habits uncommon for those accustomed to a particular gender performance for queer men, even in Korea. And, for those who believe I have disillusioned myself into believing I am a force of vigor, you have missed my point.

Instead, I am trying to communicate these ideas of what men ought to do, and how my submission into them contradict also the expectations for queer men, so nights in Itaewon seemingly ended with foreigners and locals, men and women, questioning if I was open-minded or interested in play. Jisoo, however, let me know it was specifically the way I dress and act, the superficial window to my self. 

Men in Korea, regardless of sexuality, will submit to this standard of speech and clothing for nights out. Those wanting more attention, however, would sport either tight-fitted clothing or streetwear instead: “princessas.” This became the confusion for others; though, in the spirit of eternal youth, I hope to never graduate to "La Reina." 

## \[7\] Open Topic
### Wait, what time is it in California right now? 

Before I left Los Angeles, my family hosted a block party, and having chosen a school far, far away, these conversations are almost always scripted, ending with their sentiments about how much I have changed from the last time they saw me. 

Well, amidst his drunken stupor, my uncle shared with me how proud he had been of my travels around the world. Nevertheless, hidden beneath his empty gaze while asking for the bottle opener from my hands was the vicarious living he had done through my studies, from my life outside of Boyle Heights. He imagined the museums I had roamed, the languages I had heard, the lovers I had taken, and the life I had lived. 

I told him about my upcoming flight to Korea to which he had responded by asking why I was going. I realized then that 1) I do not know how to explain why I chose to study in Korea and 2) my family really does not know much about me. I asked him if he knew what it was I even studied; he looked around for a moment, pulled me in, and whispered “Mijo, I have asked every single person here, and none of us know.” Well.

So, here is my explanation. I started at Duke as a computational linguist in pursuit of solutions for language preservation technologies for indigenous languages. My background as K’iche’ Maya serves as the genesis for my scholarship with the goal of graduate school to persist in my inquiry. 

Though, as graduate programs continue to be slashed during this administration, I have to begin to think more realistically about life after graduation as a rising senior. And, after participating in the Duke in New York program, I began to consider my life as a writer over the Duke path of software engineer or consultant. Seoul, however, fits into this as part of my broader exposure to cultural inquiry and investigation about living. Sure, this may sound made up or like I am dragging on a simple thought about uncertainty. 

However, knowing that my chores in New York City and Seoul would be to 1) live a life and 2) write about it, I knew I could experience some of what it means to be an artist. 

I just do not know how to explain that. 

## \[8\] Open Topic
### Oh, your mother!

All artists dream, some in the day, some at night. Very few dream in both, and I am no exception. Instead, nightmares wake me routinely, each convincing me that God is real but never enough to attend service. 

Well, in my most recent episode, I stood in my childhood home with my mother behind the kitchen island counter and kid brother standing in the living room directly across. I assume we had just exited an argument, and our dispute turned physical. Here, I collared all the glassware from the dining room and shattered it across the floor. I stood in front of my brother, slashed his legs and shouted once: “Now crawl.” My mother watched. 

She looked up at me as if this were the first good thing I had done. And, since reading Crying in H Mart, a memoir by Michelle Zauner, I have been forced (yes) to consider her love, these nightmares one of her many punishments. 

Your whole life, you hear about heartbreak; but, navigating the feeling of falling out of love with someone could never be explained. I was never an easy baby, and I was not a good boy either. I was born an American, and I was rude. So, I was punished for this, and it makes sense too. 

I made trouble for Maria del Carmen, or just ‘Carmen’ in front of my friends she never liked. I could never get it right, so I chose not to. I came home on mushrooms one Christmas; I applied to college without telling anyone; I tattooed my back and chest thinking of my body as hers, something to ruin like permanent marker on the walls.

Our love hurts. Crying in H Mart, however, reminds me of our most volatile argument. Who knows what started it because those things almost never matter. Instead, our back and forth ended with my shouting, “I hate the food you make!” She left for her bedroom. Now, this was not the first time my father came to scold me for how I treated his wife, but this time his script matured. “You broke your mother’s heart.”

In the years to follow, I would learn to break my mother’s heart a million times over. Yet, this one, this one time I will remember forever. She would be whose heart I break first. 

My mother had dreamt of attending college but was tasked with caring for a family. Though, after bearing only sons, she recognized that she could build our lives as well. This would have to be enough. As a homemaker, she took incredible pride in her kitchen and cooking. Who was I to insult her food?

I quit sharing meals with her, and on the off chance we see each other, our family knows not to seat us next to one another. That is family, I tell myself. Still, I miss her cooking. I miss the agua de jamaica she would prepare every summer, the fried plantain she would fix for my birthday, the handmade tortillas she would sear every finals week, the million and a half dishes she knew with stories she never told. 

After reading chapter one of Zauner’s memoir, I called her. I called my mom. 

I do not know what to say to her, and what is more than that, I know she does not know either.
