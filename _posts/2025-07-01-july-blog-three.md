Hey, everyone! Glad you found your way, but just wanted to say this is where I will be discussing my time in Seoul. If you don't hate me, you could also check out some of my other blog posts or About section to see what it is I actually do here!

## \[1\] First Impressions of Seoul

My father would often remind me to correct my posture because, at five years old, I would usually lean and hold a conversation with my head tilted off to the side. So, outside our church, every Sunday, he would ask me to mimic his steps exactly, meaning I would eventually adopt the gait of a man in his mid-thirties as a child. Just beyond our church in Koreatown, on Wilshire and Normandie, my father would hold me back while letting my brothers enter the service. 

I recall that the other parents outside were also giving their children lessons on etiquette before entering, and I continued with this idea that all churches were this way, attending three times a week until the pandemic. Eventually, I learned better and asked my parents why we attended service farther away when we lived in Boyle Heights, to which my father let me know he and my mother had been members since my father's arrival in the United States after fleeing the Guatemalan Indigenous genocide in 1992. 

That same year, tensions between minority groups in the area arose, and my dad arrived in Pico-Union. In this nearby ghetto, he naturally found Spanish services offered. It was there that he eventually met my mother and learned English, as she had arrived in the United States nearly a decade prior. My parents found comfort here, but they would often remind me of the struggle in Koreatown following the riots and how, for these reasons, I should be considerate of the space we occupy and how we represent not just our family but people as well. Peace and presentation was the aim, so I wound up sitting on the curb on many an occasion when I could not maintain this appearance as a hyperactive child(allegedly). 

Thus, before I arrived at ICN, my family reminded me of their experiences, and while I welcomed their input, there lives a clear distinction between the past and present and the unique circumstances of my departure to Seoul. Nevertheless, walking through these neighborhoods, late in Itaewon or bright and early in Sinchon, I am reminded of the fight for visibility on a global scale as I consider how my family's history in Los Angeles is tied to that of the Korean people and diaspora. 

Following the riots, tensions remained high, and several churches in the area with Spanish services began losing numbers. Yet, the shared market and hustle culture inspired my latest journey into Gwangjang Market for any and all vegetarian options with Nabarissa as my allergies to meat reappeared. Maybe this resurrgence is my sign to follow my parents and attend a service directly after a night with friends. We will see.


## \[2\] Soundscape

The idea of a bath with dozens of other men may not appeal to everyone. Still, having frequented traditional sweat lodges with the men in my family, I have become accustomed to such a routine; though, my experience at this bathhouse was anything but customary. 

Upon entering the bathhouse, I was immediately confronted with the soundscape of the city, as the bustling traffic raced alongside pedestrians, and motorcycles evaded traffic by skidding their tires onto pedestrian-only pavement. At the same time, streetcars whirred at red lights, waiting for the moment to force a hiss from their engines when the light turned green. 

Nevertheless, walking up the stairs to the bathhouse prompted me to consider this culture of discretion and a ceremony of whispering, as the attendant requested that I take my shoes off before determining whether I was a decent enough foreigner to meet the expectations of the local clientele. Well, I am; and, I was granted entry. 

After securing my belongings, the associate offered me a washcloth and bath towel, along with the other paraphernalia you would expect at one of these establishments. Well, as I entered the showers, I knew this was not a sauna I would recommend to the other men in my family. No, this was more open-minded. 

Passing through the rooms, however, strengthened my understanding of contemporary living in Seoul, as the sound of lighters igniting cigarettes echoed throughout the first-floor locker room. Whereas, upstairs, the smack of sandals against the tile and wood floors moved almost in unison, calculated to mimic the gait of the man in front of you. 

Before leaving, however, I noticed foreigners speaking English, which also contributed to my acquaintance with the soundscape of Korea, as the influence of the American Empire has led English to become a de facto language, even among those who are not from the Anglophone world. Yet, I would only encounter more of this familiar soundscape upon my arrival in Itaewon. 

Despite most queer nightclubs championing K-pop, Itaewon sits as a mecca for foreign-born and local people interested in dancing and nightlife, meaning weekends in the summer mean promoters grabbing the attention of passersbys as electronic, Latin, and house music fill the streets. Once the night wore off, however, and the bus back to Sinchon arrived, exhausted students chose to respect the peace by practicing silence as early morning commuters head into work.

Eventually, my night (now morning) ended with the Sounds of Seoul running back in my head as I dozed off and almost missed my station. The howls from the sauna, international accents, lighters catching cigarettes, and racing streetcars will definitely be hard to forget.
