Unlike the Fall, the Spring semester only has one institutional break after months of being run by the miniature linguistics professors. And, unlike every student across the country, my friends and I chose to repose with the cult classics in Cancun. Our recess would now be my second time in Mexico, but I would be without my Abuelita holding my hand as I struggled with the language, not Spanish but Paisa.

This pilgrimage would only be my second time in the motherland, or whatever you call the place where you buy novelty tequila after several shots of free liquor from preying salesmen. However, this incident began originally as an attempt to source groceries but quickly turned into a pursuit for Soju. However, the attendants at each liquor store shared the same response: "Estás en México, no en Corea." Now, I realize this request was likely a stretch, but their judgmental stares followed me as I exited; I eventually found myself seated at a tequila booth with nothing but time and two friends I had told I would return to over two hours ago. 

Eventually, Irma, Ayşe, and I landed back in Durham—mostly.

Moreover, with my twenty-first birthday soon approaching, The Burden was now underway, as I would have to sponsor my mother's citizenship. Jokingly, I am reminded of every time friends have told me they were never meant to be an intended chapter in their parents' story. I was, and I was made well aware that my twenty-first birthday served as a celebration of the war they fought. I am meant to fulfill this role as the sole American and cry to someone greater than my parents. 

On my birthday, I surrounded myself with everyone I have loved and witnessed my genesis. Since my arrival, you have all caught a glimpse of my life from beginning to end. I have made hate and even more love. I have forgiven myself and formed grudges. I have broken hearts and made art with others. I have undone years of schooling and had to learn it all over again. I have been young and careless. And, above it all, I have loved you all. 

In other news, I finally met with my children, Joel and Amy, from Mi Gente. Our conversation in the gardens brought me back to the first few days with Cris and Ashley and reminded me that I would be their mentor, just as they were mine. In every way, our stories have been united, and I carry all of myself and those I have loved through these new experiences.
