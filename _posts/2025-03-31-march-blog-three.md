Unlike the Fall, the Spring semester only has one break to catch my breath after months of schoolwork and small linguistics professors commanding my life. Also, unlike every student across the country, my friends and I chose a remote destination to repose with only the locals: Cancun. Our recess would now be my second time in Mexico over the last year, but I would be without my Abuelita holding my hand the entire time as I pretended not to be curious about the local tequila.

After our flight to Mexico, I realized this would only be my second time in the motherland, or whatever you call the place where you mistakenly buy novelty horchata and mango tequila after being seduced by free liquor from salesmen who speak Yucatec Maya. However, this venture started as an attempt to source aloe vera for Ayse. Still, it quickly turned into a hunt for the same Soju Irma and I had while studying abroad in Europe, where an alien accent accompanied the Spanish. You would witness my life from beginning to end if you could only hear our last moments together. 

Eventually, we bid farewell to the foreigners in Mexico and landed back in Durham, with my twenty-first birthday soon approaching. The burden was now underway, as I would quickly have to sponsor my mother's citizenship, and I was reminded of every time a friend had told me they were never an intended chapter in their parents' story. I was. I am meant to fulfill this role as the sole American and cry to someone greater than myself that my parents are as well. 

Instead, I spent the night with this family I have created for myself, a mastery I have developed since my freshman year. On my birthday, I surrounded myself with everyone I have loved during my time here, and I cherish each of you. Though I firmly believe that a 'favorite' anything rids us of the beauty in this world, I could not imagine a more favorite birthday, from my first breath to my last. 

In other news, I finally met with my children, Joel and Amy, from Mi Gente. Our conversation in the gardens brought me back to the first days with Cris and Ashley and reminded me that I would be their mentor, just as they were mine. However, I could never imagine holding the same flames they had and saving me when I could not. In every way, our stories have been connected, and I carry all of myself and those I have loved through these new loves of mine. 

My birthday had passed, and my schedule with these seniors soon opened up as I could now (legally) enter these previously foreign spaces. Among them, Irma and I joined Sedi on her birthday at Boxcar, though Irma had to be more creative with her entrance. We spent the night celebrating with Hawaiin rolls and watching as time sped up for just us.
