Once Dani arrived from Italy, we mourned, yearned, and grieved while overlooking the London skyline from my bedroom window. The whole weekend, we reflected upon this brutal film about the journey of a Peruvian explorer in Europe. While living out his family's dream of seeing the world, he also outlived his family and home, a painful innuendo to our experiences as first-generation students: Paddington.

The movie tore away at us, and we frequently returned to the film's messages while roaming the British Museum, wondering how, like Paddington and these artifacts, we wound up here, too. What moves the stars, and why did they move for us? Seemingly, I was brought back to my freshman fall, meeting Dani for the first time, and how fortunate we are to meet everyone when we are supposed to.

## Budapest, Vienna, and Prague

I held onto these ideas as I traveled throughout Eastern Europe. Upon first landing in Budapest, I hurried toward the pier, where I was met with a glass of sparkling wine on a last-minute prosecco cruise along the river Danube. After a blur of FaceTime calls with my Abuelita and Irma, I found myself in the Buda castle gardens with enough Hungarian Forint to sponsor a stranger's journey home to Moscow. I will never know where I acquired the cash, and I honestly do not want to know either. That will remain between those gardens and nightfall. 

Afterward, in Vienna, though, I was reminded of my time studying in Guatemala, where I learned that the Welt Museum carries the ceremonial headdress of Moctezuma II, the final ruler of the Aztec Empire. Why was this quetzal crown in Vienna? "It remains unclear exactly how and when it left Mexico" (<a href="https://www.weltmuseumwien.at/en/the-feather-headdress/" target="_blank">source</a>). Hmm, I think we learned this in grade school. Something-something-1492-something-something-sailed the ocean blue? 

Anywho, I roamed the city with the voices of my friends, family, and teachers from Guatemala following me as I continued our indigenous story, even thousands of miles from Central America. Finally, I sent a prayer, chose a train platform, and was thankful to have woken up in Prague after noticing almost everything at the train station was written in either German or Czech. 

## Final Days

After visiting Oxford once I got back from Prague, I took the first train back to London to reunite with Saphal and Brock, who would be staying with me. We were finally roommates again, and before I left for class Monday morning, I left the blinds closed so the sunlight wouldn't wake them. Later, at 3PM, I got a text from Saphal that they had only just now woken up after sleeping for nearly fifteen hours. 

Eventually, their planes took off, and I spent my last few days of October in Oxford watching horror movies and drinking cheap wine, amidst other things, alongside all the same wonderful faces as before: Sarah, Sophie, Rishi, Nancy, Lia, and Aubteen. 

Before leaving, though, I roamed the gardens alone and made plans back in London with Mina, Summer, Vysa, Fatouma, Nevena, and Isa. Seemingly, I could feel time fleeting as I read and re-read emails reminding us that our time abroad was coming to an end. 

Not yet, though.
