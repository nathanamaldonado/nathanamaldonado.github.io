      <h2 class="headline-title">NORTH CAROLINA INDIE WITH A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHTICK</h2>
      <h3 class="headline-sub">WHAT ARE YOU ON RIGHT NOW?</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! I started this blog to document my experiences as a young adult far from home and to share my life with strangers online. I am originally from Southern California, but my family has moved around a bit, so I usually tell people I am from East Los Angeles because that is where I feel most connected to my community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently in my senior year at Duke University under the University Scholars Program, where I study linguistics, computer science, and psychology, with plans to work in the digital humanities. Sure, everyone mentions the culture shock of moving to the South for college, but North Carolina has shown me life in the sun and shadows, truly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, I chose Duke because of the opportunity to study K'iche'—our family's indigenous language in Guatemala. Following La Violencia in Guatemala, my father hesitated to teach me K'iche'. His sacrifice has since fueled my passion to serve a broader indigenous revival effort across the Americas and in every space I occupy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As for what I am on usually, I am a proud older brother of twins who attend UC Irvine and UC San Diego; I am a polyglot (English, Spanish, French, and K'iche'); I laugh on roller coasters and during horror movies; I failed my written driver's test three times; I got five facial piercings for $25 from a guy offering an unlimited discount; I am a Coffeehouse barista. Lastly, I am a California elitist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nonetheless, I am not on this journey alone. Instead, as you read my updates, you will hear about all the incredible people I have met and all the unbelievable experiences I have shared with them. Each person you meet in college will become part of your story, and I hope to be part of your story as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank You!
      </p>

          Immediately following the last few deadlines of junior year, some friends and I crammed our belongings into Riley's minivan and hit the road. We started out along the North Carolina coast and were approached by a group of women wanting to take our photo. Now, it remains one of my favorite moments from undergrad, rolling up my pant legs to my knees and washing away the sand from under the communal showers. At the same time, Aaron and Dalya aggressively removed sand from their shoes and tried not to rub their eyes.
